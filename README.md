# What does it mean to be a man?

You can access the data (raw-responses.csv) and the survey questions on the Github page https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/masculinity-survey.

Make sure that your plots have interpretable legends and titles. Using themes and colors that differ from the ggplot2 defaults is encouraged.

1.	Reproduce the figures and tables in the article, but do separate analyses for Straight and Gay / Bisexual men. Don’t do the breakup by age groups: there aren’t many Gay / Bisexual men in the sample, so breaking up the analysis further into age groups leaves us with very few observations in some categories. Do you notice any differences? Explain what you see in a few paragraphs, written in non-technical terms.

2.	Reproduce the figures and tables in the article as in part 1, but now break up the analysis into White / non White men. Again, don’t do the break up by age groups. Explain what you see.

3.	The survey had questions that weren’t used in the article. Explain the results in 2 questions that weren’t analyzed. Compare the answers by some demographic information (education, age group, ethnicity, sexuality, etc.).
